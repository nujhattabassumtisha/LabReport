This task involves implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path in a randomly generated N X N grid with obstacles. The program ensures the source and goal are placed in open spaces and explores possible paths using DFS. It prints the grid, the discovered path (if any) and the order of node traversal. This demonstrates fundamental graph traversal techniques useful for applications.
